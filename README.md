The program creates a bot that logs a user into their linkedin account, then searches for jobs under search terms specified by user.
The bot selects the jobs that are labelled 'easy apply', and submits applications that require at most a 2-step process.
The bot is created using selenium, and is applied to the Google Chrome browser.
